<h1>History Of Google</h1>
Google has its origins in "BackRub", a research project that was begun in 1996 by Larry Page and
 Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.[2] The project 
initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the 
original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[3][4] Hassan went on to pursue a 
career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.</p>

<p>In the search of a dissertation theme, Page had been considering among other things exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph.[7] His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pick this idea (which Page later recalled as "the best advice I ever got"[8]) and Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page, based on the consideration that the number and nature of such backlinks was valuable information about that page (with the role of citations in academic publishing in mind).[7] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[3]<p>
